The Paris Institute for Advanced Study (Paris IAS) invites scholars from around the world, known as Fellows, to conduct cutting-edge research across various disciplines, from the humanities to the natural sciences. Selected for their innovative work, Fellows enjoy intellectual freedom to pursue ambitious, often interdisciplinary projects. 

The Institute fosters a vibrant academic community, offering opportunities for collaboration through seminars, workshops, and conferences. Fellows also benefit from access to Paris' rich network of universities and research centers, enhancing their research and public outreach. 

Through their work, Fellows address pressing global issues, advancing knowledge and shaping critical debates in their fields, contributing to the Institute's lasting impact on contemporary scholarship.
