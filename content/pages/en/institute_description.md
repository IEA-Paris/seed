## Hosting excellence

As a home for scientiﬁc life, the Paris IAS welcomes international researchers from a variety  of disciplines, facilitates their exchanges and supports their interactions with the Parisian scientiﬁc community  and the extra-academic world. 

Freed from the day-to-day obligations of university  life, these researchers carry out, individually or in groups, the scientiﬁc project of their choice, in a setting that encourages the development of new perspectives. In its annual selection, the IAS encourages research projects that address major world problems.[](/resources)
