## Creating tools for collective intelligence

As a major player in innovation in the human, social and cognitive sciences, the IAS is developing various projects in partnership with its members and other institutes for advanced study around the world to foster collaborative research on complex issues.

The creation of digital infrastructures for collective intelligence on an international scale and the development of research networks on major scientiÔ¨Åc and societal challenges (Constructive Advanced Thinking program, Intercontinental Academia, etc.) are concrete examples of this policy.
