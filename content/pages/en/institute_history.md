## An outstanding place and history

Since 2013, the Paris IAS has been housed in the Hôtel de Lauzun, an exceptional site dedicated by the City of Paris to the advancement of the human and social sciences. Built between 1656 and 1660 for Charles Gruyn, the king's financier and secretary, the Hôtel de Lauzun is one of the capital's finest private mansions. It boasts a remarkable interior decoration and, over the years, has been home to a number of outstanding personalities, including the Comte de Lauzun, Théophile Gautier and Charles Baudelaire.

During the latter's stay in 1845, the salons of the Hôtel de Lauzun, then known as the Hôtel Pimodan, were regularly devoted to the very private parties of the Club des Haschichins, where artists and personalities of the time experimented with "artificial paradises".

Thanks to Baron Jérôme Pichon, a great lover of art, who housed his collections there, and above all to his nephew, Louis, the Hôtel de Lauzun was largely restored between the 2nd half of the 19th century and the interwar period. Since 1928, it has belonged to the City of Paris, which launched extensive renovation work in 2012 to house the Institute. Today, this unique architectural ensemble combines heritage rooms from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries with modernized, functional spaces - offices, meeting rooms, workspaces, library - making it an exceptional workplace for the fellows of the Paris Institute for Advanced Study.
