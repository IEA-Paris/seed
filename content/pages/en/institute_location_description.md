## Building bridges

The Institute develops interactions with local and global research ecosystems, civil society, and the socio-economic world in order to increase the impact of scientiﬁc work in the human, social and cognitive sciences, beyond disciplinary and sectoral boundaries.

Dialogue between academics, citizens, and political decision-makers facilitates reﬂection on present and future societal challenges. Regular meetings and events give new audiences easier access to research results.
