Apex is the code name of an ongoing project of a micro-services-based infrastructure designed to serve the needs of both institutes for advanced studies and our university and academic members.

The first micro-services are:

- File Upload (signed URLs, multipart uploads, large files allowed, out of the box AES encryption)
- Form submission (Contact forms, Forms to spreadsheets for surveys and questionnaires...)
- Taxonomy (see [OSMI](https://paris-iea.fr/activities/projects/osmi) for more information)
- Newsletter
- Event booking
- Authentication provider (ORCID, ISNI, Github, PARIS IAS) for open authorship, reviewing or translation
- Dissemination service (Zenodo, OpenAire, HAL, goTriple...)
