The World Pandemic Research Network (WPRN) is dedicated to facilitating international collaboration in pandemic research. It focuses on generating knowledge, data, and tools that can be shared across nations to better understand and combat pandemics. Through partnerships with institutions like the Institut d'Études Avancées de Paris (Paris IAS), WPRN brings together leading experts to address the complex challenges posed by global health crises.

The research initiatives span various disciplines including artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and global health strategies. WPRN regularly hosts events that aim to foster dialogue, enhance collaboration, and push forward the boundaries of pandemic research. Through a transdisciplinary approach, the network seeks to develop innovative solutions that can be applied in real-world pandemic preparedness and response efforts.
