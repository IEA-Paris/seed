The Clean Oceans Initiative (COI) is dedicated to reducing ocean pollution and restoring marine ecosystems through large-scale cleanup efforts, sustainable waste management practices, and international collaborations. COI aims to drastically reduce plastic waste in the oceans by 2030 and promote long-term sustainability in marine conservation.

Through research, advocacy, and partnerships with coastal communities, governments, and corporations, COI works to implement effective solutions that address both the causes and effects of ocean pollution. By engaging communities and stakeholders, COI is committed to ensuring the future health of the world's oceans.
