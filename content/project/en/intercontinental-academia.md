The Intercontinental Academia (ICA) seeks to create a global network of future research leaders in which some of the very best early/mid‐career scholars will work together on paradigm‐shifting cross‐disciplinary research, mentored by some of the most eminent researchers from across the globe.

The 4th edition of the ICA explores the complementarities between artificial intelligence and neuro/cognitive-science and the tremendous challenges and opportunities they raise for humanity.
