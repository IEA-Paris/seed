The Global Reforestation Initiative (GRI) is committed to combating deforestation and climate change by restoring forests worldwide. Through large-scale tree planting projects, partnerships with local governments, and community-based reforestation programs, GRI aims to reforest millions of hectares of land and restore ecosystems that have been damaged by deforestation.

GRI also focuses on promoting sustainability and integrating reforestation into broader climate strategies, emphasizing the importance of local engagement and sustainable land use. By working with experts, policymakers, and communities, GRI seeks to create a future where forests flourish and carbon emissions are significantly reduced.
