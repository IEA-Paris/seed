A French-Canadian, Daniel Pauly has studiedgroups.0 the documentation and mitigation of the impact of fisheries on the planet's marine ecosystems. The concepts, methods and software he has (co)developed are documented in over 1000 widely cited contributions, and have earned him numerous scientific awards, including the Légion d'Honneur. A comprehensive biography (_Daniel Pauly - un océan de combats_ by David Grémillet), published in French in 2019 and in English in 2021 under the title _The Ocean's Whistleblower - the remarkable life and work of Daniel Pauly_, presents Daniel Pauly's work and influence in detail. He joins the IEA in May 2025 for a month-long writing residency.

### Areas of interest

Global and small-scale fisheries, marine biology

### Research project

Small-scale fishing in the southern hemisphere: its importance, even for Europe **Small-scale fishing in the southern hemisphere: its importance, even for Europe** Small-scale fishing in the southern hemisphere: its importance, even for Europe

The study of small-scale fisheries in Africa, Asia, America and Oceania, and their conflicts with large-scale industrial fisheries, is often regarded as an intellectually sterile activity.

However, it's important to realize that these artisanal fisheries are not simply a part of the informal economy that governments and academics overlook; they play a major role in ensuring the food security of their countries. Yet they often go unnoticed in national statistics and even by fisheries economists.
It's only when things go wrong that artisanal fishing and its players - mainly fishermen and fish traders - appear in the field of vision of wealthy countries. For example, thousands of fishermen try to reach Europe on rickety boats, and hundreds of them drown. They have left their homes because there are no fish left to catch in their home waters, largely due to the industrial fishing fleets of the developed world.
This work will link the activities of distant-water fishing fleets off West Africa to (i) the lethal migration problems mentioned above, (ii) the desperate situation of small-scale fishing in the region, and (iii) the food security problems associated with the processing of West African staples (sardines and other small, cheap fish) into fishmeal to feed salmon, for example, in Norway. This study would be an important contribution at a time when global issues of equity and sustainability are rightly considered paramount.
