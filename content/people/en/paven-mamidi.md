Pavan Mamidi is the Director of the Centre for Social and Behavior Change (CSBC) at Ashoka University. He led the initiative to set up India's first Nudge Unit at Niti Aayog in New Delhi, as well as in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar as well.

In January 2025, he joins the IAS for a one-month writing residency.

### Research Interests

Behavioral science for policy, privacy, AI, philosophy of science.

Research project

**Designing a behavioural experiment to measure the cost of autonomy due to predictive AI and nudging
**

The extensive use of behavioural nudging, and AI to segment citizens into various personas, and target interventions to produce behaviour changes are likely to result in a loss of "surprisingness" and autonomy in the lives of humans. How do we reconcile the brilliant promise of AI, with social and psychological costs of loss in autonomy and privacy?
