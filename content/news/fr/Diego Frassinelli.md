**Human language processing** has always been rather peculiar and quite fascinating! In such a complex realm, [**Diego**](/fellows#frassinelli "Diego Frassinelli"), who is an Assistant Professor in Artificial Intelligence at the Department of Linguistics, University of Konstanz, is investigating **if social and cultural aspects are captured by neural language models**.

He explains it much better himself in his research pitch!
