Marie Dupuis, a geologist from Université de Grenoble, takes us on a journey through the Earth's geological layers. From tectonics to sedimentology, she explores how the Earth's structure has evolved over time.

In her latest fieldwork, Marie investigates **tectonic plate movements** and their impact on mountain formation. In collaboration with the Earth Sciences Research Group, she has contributed to projects focusing on the hydrological cycle and the fossil record, revealing new insights into Earth's past.

**Discover more about geology** and explore these fascinating topics in the latest **podcast series** where Marie discusses her work with fellow geologists.
