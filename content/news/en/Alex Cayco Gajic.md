is Junior Professor in the Département d’Etudes Cognitives at École Normale Supérieure in Paris. Let's hear all about her research from herself, as she explains **"From movement to cognition: Understanding cerebello-cortical coordination for flexible learning"** through a bite-sized video pitch.

More about Alex:

Alex Cayco Gajic is a neuroscientist who works on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in flexible learning. She is a junior professor at École Normale Supérieure in Paris, where she is in the Group for Neural Theory at the Laboratory for Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience. Previously, she was a research associate at University College London. She received her PhD in Applied Mathematics in 2015 from the University of Washington. For her project at the **4th Intercontinental Academia**, she proposes to investigate **the links between sensorimotor and cognitive behaviours** with a focus on cerebello-cortical coordination. In particular, she wishes to explore how a cognitive internal model in the cerebellum could aid the neocortex in adapting to unexpected changes in cognitive tasks.

**Excited to learn more about this?**

Listen to the **ICA4 podcast** in which Alex talks about **Intelligence and the Brain** in an interview with Mike Livermore:
