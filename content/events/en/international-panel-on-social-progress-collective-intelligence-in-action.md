### Présentation

Inspired by the work of international panels on climate (IPCC) or biodiversity (IPBES), the International Panel for Social Progress was founded in 2014 as an international initiative of 350 researchers wishing to contribute to improving the way societies function in the face of the triple challenge of environmental degradation, widening inequalities and renewed forms of democratic deliberation.

The Panel's first cycle (2015-2019) resulted in the production of a report "Rethinking Societies for the 21st Century" published in three volumes by Cambridge University Press in 2018. A Manifesto for Social Progress was published and translated into eight languages. Over 100 dissemination events had been organized worldwide: in universities, with international organizations and non-governmental organizations.

The main innovation of the Panel's second cycle (2023-2027) is to involve change agents (associations, entrepreneurs, researchers, philanthropists, governments, etc.) in identifying the best solutions for transforming our societies and implementing them in an inclusive, sustainable and democratic way. An international Advisory Board made up of 60 leading figures active in these different sectors of society (www.ipsp.org).

The first meeting of the Panel's Advisory Board will take place at the Paris Institute for Advanced Study from September 27 to 29, 2023.
