      Research projects proposed at the Paris IAS can be in all disciplines and themes of the humanities and social sciences and must have an interdisciplinary dimension.

      The essential selection criterion is the excellence of the project and its leader. The Paris IAS aims above all to support original projects (methods, interdisciplinarity, theoretical innovation...), which significantly advance the state of the art. The impact of the research beyond the discipline and/or the academic field is also taken into account.

      The Paris IAS also supports work aimed at addressing major and urgent threats to the future of our societies, giving researchers complete freedom to choose the theme, on the sole condition that they respond to these vital issues through fundamental research or intersectoral collaborative projects (associating non-academic actors: the political, economic, and associative worlds).

      APPLICATIONS

      Application deadline: April, on the IAS website (link to application platform).</p>

      In advance of this date, the IAS organizes virtual question-and-answer sessions for Parisian researchers wishing to invite their colleagues, and for international researchers wishing to send in their applications.

      SELECTION
      Scientific selection is based on an independent international evaluation.

      June: verification of eligibility by xxxxx
      July to October: double evaluation by xxxx
      In November: pre-selection by xxxxxx and communication of pre-selection results 
      In January - February: selection of laureates by the IAS Scientific Advisory Board and communication of results.
  profile: |-
        The call is open to researchers of all career levels (from postdoctoral to senior researcher).

        A minimum of a PhD + 2 years' research experience is required at the time of application. Exceptions are possible for researchers with a Master's degree + 6 years' full-time research experience after graduation (doctoral training will not be taken into account in calculating experience).

        Researchers from all countries are eligible, but must not have spent more than 12 months in France in the three years preceding the application deadline.

        Applicants must be fluent in English.

  tasks: |-
        During their stay, residents undertake to spend the majority of their time in Paris and to participate in scientific exchanges within the Institute.

        The Paris IAS values collective intelligence and interdisciplinarity. Resident researchers are therefore expected to contribute actively to discussions and the common life of the Institute, during the compulsory weekly internal seminar at which a researcher presents his or her research, at communal lunches, at the monthly Tuesday Wine & Conversation get-togethers, and beyond.

        They will also be asked to give at least one public lecture.

        Fellows are expected to keep the IAS informed of their participation in conferences, seminars and external scientific events.

        They must also make known their publications, awards and distinctions, etc.

        In published articles and books, as well as when participating in scientific events outside the Institute, they must mention their status as IAS fellows.

  meals: |-
     The IAS offers fellows the opportunity to have lunch in the Institute's canteen from Monday to Friday. It is also possible (and strongly encouraged) to invite researchers from outside the Institute to lunch in order to foster exchanges and discussions with the Parisian scientific community.

      Rates :
      Fellows meal: x euros
      Guest meal: x euros.
      Invoiced monthly to the fellow.

      Registration procedure: Each fellow is registered by default with the catering service from Monday to Friday. For obvious reasons of waste reduction, any forecast absence must be notified one week before the date of the meal not taken. Meals not taken and not notified in advance will be billed.
