      APPLICATIONS

      Application deadline: April, on the IAS website (link to application platform).</p>

      In advance of this date, the IAS organizes virtual question-and-answer sessions for Parisian researchers wishing to invite their colleagues, and for international researchers wishing to send in their applications.

      SELECTION
      Scientific selection is based on an independent international evaluation.

      June: verification of eligibility by xxxxx
      July to October: double evaluation by xxxx
      In November: pre-selection by xxxxxx and communication of pre-selection results 
      In January - February: selection of laureates by the IAS Scientific Advisory Board and communication of results.
  profile: |-
        The call is open to researchers of all career levels (from postdoctoral to senior researcher).

        A minimum of a PhD + 2 years' research experience is required at the time of application. Exceptions are possible for researchers with a Master's degree + 6 years' full-time research experience after graduation (doctoral training will not be taken into account in calculating experience).

        Researchers from all countries are eligible, but must not have spent more than 12 months in France in the three years preceding the application deadline.

        Applicants must be fluent in English.

  tasks: |-
        During their stay, residents undertake to spend the majority of their time in Paris and to participate in scientific exchanges within the Institute.

        The Paris IAS values collective intelligence and interdisciplinarity. Resident researchers are therefore expected to contribute actively to discussions and the common life of the Institute, during the compulsory weekly internal seminar at which a researcher presents his or her research, at communal lunches, at the monthly Tuesday Wine & Conversation get-togethers, and beyond.

        They will also be asked to give at least one public lecture.

        Fellows are expected to keep the IAS informed of their participation in conferences, seminars and external scientific events.

        They must also make known their publications, awards and distinctions, etc.

        In published articles and books, as well as when participating in scientific events outside the Institute, they must mention their status as IAS fellows.

  meals: |-
     The IAS offers fellows the opportunity to have lunch in the Institute's canteen from Monday to Friday. It is also possible (and strongly encouraged) to invite researchers from outside the Institute to lunch in order to foster exchanges and discussions with the Parisian scientific community.

      Rates :
      Fellows meal: x euros
      Guest meal: x euros.
      Invoiced monthly to the fellow.

      Registration procedure: Each fellow is registered by default with the catering service from Monday to Friday. For obvious reasons of waste reduction, any forecast absence must be notified one week before the date of the meal not taken. Meals not taken and not notified in advance will be billed.

      Support for scientific activities

      Fellows can receive financial and material support for their research work and activities. This includes in particular the organization of scientific events (study days, conferences,...), doctoral training and workshops with non-academic collaborators or audiences, as well as the translation and publication of texts.

      Access to partner research libraries

      Agreements between the IAS and its partner institutions enable residents to benefit from privileged access and extended lending rights in the main Parisian libraries from the moment of their arrival (link to the booklet bibliotheque de genevieve in pdf to download).

      Communication and promotion

      The Paris IAS announces the participation of its fellows in scientific events and their publications on its website and in its monthly newsletter. Each fellow also has a dedicated page on the IAS website, as well as those of its partners Netias and Ubias, giving a brief description of his or her background and research project.

The Paris IAS promotes a specific program to link mind and brain, humanities and social sciences and neurosciences. Particular attention is paid to topics related to major societal challenges: child development, ageing, health, education and learning, addictions, the effect of new digital and information technologies, tolerance, aggressiveness, fanaticism, etc.
The aim of this dialogue is to enable the humanities and social sciences, as well as the brain sciences, to renew their perspectives on classical objects and to open new fields of research with bold and innovative interdisciplinary approaches.
**[*More information*](https://www.paris-iea.fr/en/events-feed/22964-brain-culture-and-society-program)
The Paris IAS is a member of the [FIAS program](https://www.fias-fp.eu/) (MSCA COFUND), which offers high-level researchers in the humanities and social sciences the opportunity to carry out 10-month research residencies in five French Institutes for Advanced Study. Starting in 2021, its annual call for applications for non-thematic fellowships and fellowships in the Brain, Culture and Society program will be covered by the FIAS program.**
